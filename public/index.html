            practice my skills in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Please feel free
            to explore! For more details about this website, here is the link to

          <p class="about">
            For those who do not want to sift through my Linkedin; I was a public
            school teacher in NYC for 6 years. In 2022, I took a leap of faith and quit. I self-studied foundational JavaScript and applied to a competive coding bootcamp called Fullstack-Grace Hopper. 
            </p>
            <p class="about">
            Grace Hopper is a 17 week immersive
            software engineering program. Through this wonderful experience, I was
            able to gather precious experience making web applications. Through
            these projects, I was exposed to code reviews, github, and learned how
            to navigate team dynamics. We practiced agile project management
            methodology and learned best practices from our instructors.

          outline.
          <p >
            One of our biggest struggles was deciding user authorization and
            roles. Different roles were allowed different accesses. Taking time
            to plan this and deciding how it would look through our database
            allowed for a smoother coding experience. In the end we used 2
            through tables in PostgreSQL to help us gain access to trips and
            tasks. (Click buttons to see more.)

      <h3> * Side Note: </h3>
       <p class="projectAbout"> Personally for me, this was my first exposure to the idea of local storage and authorization. It was fun to make a persistent cart using local Storage. We understood that local storage was not recommened due to security reasons, but it was the easist to implemnet with the amount of time we had. However, with this knowledge, it became the catalyst that pushed me to use cookies for my project trippn.</p>
